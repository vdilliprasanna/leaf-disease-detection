Plant disease detection has grown in importance in recent years for both farmers and academics. Visual inspection is one of the more time-consuming and frequently based on opinion ways of disease detection. In this article, we suggest a novel method for detecting plant diseases that makes use of convolutional neural networks (CNN), SVM (support vector machine) and image processing methods. The Plant Village dataset, which includes more than 54,000 images of 14 crop species with 38 distinct classes of diseases, is presented first. We use a CNN to classify the images into the appropriate disease classifications after preprocessing the images to reduce noise and improve contrast. We assess the performance of our method on a test collection of plant images to show its efficacy. Our findings demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional disease detection techniques and compare the accuracies in identifying classifying plant diseases. Additionally, we extend our strategy to plant breeding methods, demonstrating how it can be used to recognize plant genotypes that are disease-resistant. We can create new crop varieties that are more resilient to disease and can help ensure food security in the face of climate change and other challenges by finding resistant genotypes. Overall, our method marks a major advance in the detection of plant diseases and has the potential to completely change how we approach crop management and plant breeding.

## Conclusion
In this study, convolution neural networks are applied to the problem of identifying plant diseases. Identification of the image, which is a crucial instrument for early disease detection for growth in crop output, is one of the essential applications of image processing. The time and money spent on manual prediction will be reduced with the aid of this instrument. We also infer from the findings above that Convolution Neural Network (CNN) offers a remarkable degree of accuracy in identifying diseases. We apply our strategy to plant breeding methods, showing how it can be used to identify disease resistant plant genotypes. By identifying resistant genotypes, we can develop novel crop varieties that are more disease resistant and help ensure food security in the face of climate change and other challenges.
    
## Future work
In the future, plant disease detection using image processing techniques can be extended to the field of plant breeding to enhance the development of disease-resistant plant cultivars. By incorporating advanced image processing algorithms and machine learning techniques, it is possible to create a powerful tool for selecting and breeding plants with improved resistance to various diseases. This can help reduce the reliance on chemical pesticides and promote sustainable agriculture. Additionally, the integration of remote sensing technologies and Internet of Things (IoT) can provide real-time monitoring and data collection, allowing for the early detection and management of diseases in crops. Overall, the application of image processing and machine learning techniques in plant disease detection and breeding has the potential to revolutionize agriculture and contribute to food security worldwide.
